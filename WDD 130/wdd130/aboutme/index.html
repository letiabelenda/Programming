    <h2>Leti</h2>
    <p>Hi, everyone! I'm Leticia but people call me Leti or Let and I'm from Uruguay.
        I have been member of the Church since 2011 when I was baptized at age 16.
        This cute boy you see next to me in the photo is my husband David. We have been married for 5
        happy years and although we have not yet been able to have children, we hope that soon we can be a family of three.</p>
    <p> I have many hobbies but my two favorites are drawing and reading. I love classic literature; 
        my favorite authors are: Victor Hugo, Charles Dickens, Alexandre Dumas and Wilkie Collins.</p>
